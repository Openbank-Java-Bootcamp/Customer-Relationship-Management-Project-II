# Customer-Relationship-Management-Project-II
This CRM is used to track prospective and existing customers through the sales process.   

Leads are created by entering their name, phone number, email address, and the name of their company.

When a Lead is converted into an Opportunity product information such as type and quantity are added, along with company information such as industry type, number of employees, city, and country in order to create an Account containing the company info. 

When the Opportunity is closed, the status will be changed to LOST or WON according to the situation.
